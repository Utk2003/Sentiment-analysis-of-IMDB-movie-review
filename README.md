We have used a dataset from[7], which includes a dataset containing 
50,000 surveys from IMDB that are then divided into 25,000 for testing 
and preparation. Each movie has simply thirty surveys because the audits 
and appraisals for the same movie are usually related. Additionally, there 
is a discontinuous arrangement of films in the train and test sets, thus it 
would be irrelevant to memorize individual film terms and their related 
names. An unbiased survey receives scores between >4 and <7, a 
negative survey receives a score of less than 4 out of 10, and a positive 
survey receives a score of more than 7.
